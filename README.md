# Project3-Kernel-Hacking
Project 3 of 3 of the practical work assignments for the course CT30A3370 Käyttöjärjestelmät ja systeemiohjelmointi


Not being comfortable around GitHub (and having no idea how cloning repositories works), I made a big mistake somewhere, so there seem to be 1000+ commits on the program. Also a plethora of contributors who I've never met nor know who they are. Sorry about that.

There are also two files, from which you should only care about the "xv6" -named one. That is, don't touch the one that says "DON'T TOUCH".

Even with my ineptitude with computers, the program works.

To use the program (more like a function) getreadcount():

1)    Move into the ./xv6 folder and open terminal
2)    Type 'make qemu' into the terminal to open qemu
3)    Type 'getreadcount' into the qemu terminal

The function returns the number of read() system calls made while the qemu has been on.
